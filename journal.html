    Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
    through some interesting places on the way:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
    <li>Magic city ,ID</li>
    <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
    <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
    <li>Why, AZ</li>
    <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
    <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
  </ol>
    <p>
    I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
    road today : "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get
    you , A glimpse, Of eternity." I definitely won't be passing
    any cars.

    My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
    everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
    I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, IPod,
    digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As
    Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
